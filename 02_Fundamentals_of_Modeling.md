Infotables
Infotables are the main complex base type in ThingWorx. 
Infotables are used to transmit multiple data points between events, 
services, subscriptions, and Things. 
Infotables are constrained by a Data Shape. 
Infotables may be nested if the Data Shape permits an infotable field. 
Infotables may contain multiple rows but frequently only contain one row. ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/55133252/117984309-05190b80-b338-11eb-81ee-87d978d13270.png)
